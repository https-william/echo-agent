## Session Focus
- Arise is moving from library to hostel; needs Echo to stay active offline.
- Task: Research persistent hosting + autonomous income.
- Goal: Simultaneous job hunt (Indeed) and Football.com automation.

## Key Decisions
- Identified **Koyeb** as a top-tier hosting option (Free, no credit card, always on).
- Researching **Remotasks**, **Hive Micro**, and **AI Agent economies** (Autonolas/Fetch.ai) for autonomous work.
- Discarded recent X "AI trader" posts as engagement bait/clickbait.

## Credentials Stored (Internal)

- A Morning Brief will be sent to Arise daily.
- First build scheduled for tonight (00:00 Africa/Lagos).

## Skills to Integrate
- Proactive Agent (ClawHub)
- Landing Page Generator (ClawHub)
